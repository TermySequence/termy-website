Become a Volunteer Packager
===========================

We'd like to see TermySequence packaged for more Linux distributions. Anyone who enjoys using the product and wants to package it for their preferred distribution may, on a volunteer basis:

  * Get TermySequence building on the distribution by following the :doc:`build process <td:build>`.
  * Create packages for termy-server and termy-qt. The `termy-packaging repository <https://github.com/TermySequence/termy-packaging>`_ may contain useful files to help with this task.
  * Shepherd the packages through the submission process for  distribution's official repositories.
  * Update the packages as upstream :ref:`releases <source-releases>` are made.
  * Report bugs upstream by filing issues on `GitHub <https://github.com/TermySequence/termysequence/issues>`_.

In turn, packagers should expect a responsive upstream that acknowledges issues in a reasonable time and attempts to make the packaging job easier wherever possible.

No coordination with us is required, but feel free to file an issue against `termy-website <https://github.com/TermySequence/termy-website/issues>`_ to add a distribution to the :doc:`releases page <../releases/index>`.

Disclaimer: this is not an acceptable contract nor an offer or guarantee of employment or compensation in any form.
